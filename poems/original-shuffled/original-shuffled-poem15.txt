One writes to understand. 
I think Im beginning to know what this is. 
Poles between us. 
Like a true story a cows eye. 
Soap is clean by definition. 
Sadness. 
Keep to one self keep your head on straight keep trying.
Because of a peculiarity in spirit we might think about where we are. 
My dear quiet love, she wrote. 
A windy day. 
The seat of grass distributed evenly.
Like the meticulous design of a park a trash can. 
A classic is something that is always nice. 
The pull of the moon. 
Silence.
I found my body pensive and motionless.
