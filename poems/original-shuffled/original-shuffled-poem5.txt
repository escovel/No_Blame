Have you seen them race each other? 
Wings tear off: stratosphere. 
Found object as feeling: I stare at an advertisement. 
A trench leads to each house. 
A lap is there and back. 
The body aches and fills. 
Found object as feeling: I stare at an advertisement. 
Our rent was due: the streets were full of snow. 
Whistling for the winner, women, commercial. 
The bottom of the lake: tongue. 
Things I will never understand. 
A joke, a dense work of metal. 
All the winners have medals. 
Passengers dont ask. 
Were older now, more interesting. 
Possession. I never knew how exciting addiction could be.
