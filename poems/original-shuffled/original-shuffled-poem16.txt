A dog crawls under the porch to die. 
Geese fly south in the winter. 
I shook my head yes, empty. 
Theres so much to say about appearance: old pink T-shirt. 
A dog crawls under the porch to die. 
A meteorite hits the earth: Ill give you something to cry about. 
Terrified on missing out, the sun rose early. 
Color is the first thing to go: I squint in the sun. 
Things I will never understand. 
Horses and people used to be smaller. 
A snake bashes its front tooth on a rock. 
In Japan In Japan In Japan In Japan. 
Things I will never understand. 
Ive never seen a dinosaur though Ive seen its skeleton. 
We write poems like zippers. 
Ice Cube is a caricature of himself.
