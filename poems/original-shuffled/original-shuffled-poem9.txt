It came from the sky, mostly. 
I found a hole in my sock I found a foot stool. 
We sat together. 
We contain each other. 
Carry your body as you would a baby. 
If I disappeared today tomorrow would you carry a picture of someone not here anymore? 
Its heart, still beeping. 
Its too cold to party (unless youre in Russia). 
To see what life was like I asked the man pushing his car. 
Like a magnet like concrete the mans eyes were rotten two holes like a plug. 
She loved the sea. 
Compare your notes. 
A rut gleaming in the snow. 
Not like a bonnet pushed back a horde of neck and hands. 
What are the Pistons thinking? 
We nod over breakfast, hands over the sun.
