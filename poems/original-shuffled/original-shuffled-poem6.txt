I wake up at eight I shoot the machine gun. 
the odds 
Ive seen a six-toed cat. 
Count the number of ships coming into this harbor. 
I flick an insect off the bed. 
a postal distribution center 
Some people are born with webbing between their toes. 
I want to be a better person 
The sounds of a shovel and now the work man and now the work man. 
a great catch 
Im going through one of those cycles. 
The best I can do is describe it. 
Like Stephen Hawking sorrow expanding like a rowers meticulous form. 
the sun 
The shape of a life or the life itself? 
I presume the thing before the thing, ideas of what the world is
