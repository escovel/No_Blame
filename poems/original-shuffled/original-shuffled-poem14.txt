I can only imagine with the help of a toy. 
Wanting to impress the leather jacket.
An ornate bridge leads to an empty parking lot. 
Does this have anything to do with how we read? 
My neck bends like a branch covered in snow. 
Sucking on a dog's eyeball.
Theyre racing across the pool, racing each other. 
We find what we are looking for by isolating what we are looking for from the things around it. 	 
A pair of pants that fits. 
The curve rolls silently down the hill.
Instincts or repeated thoughts, swimmers appear on the television. 
Why do ABCD appear in the same place at the same time? 
In Japan it takes less than two weeks for a product to reach 100% market saturation. 
Like the sun on one's face the smell of grass.
Isolating each thought, picking them apart from each other. 
There are other things with them, such the paper you are reading this on or where youre sitting.
