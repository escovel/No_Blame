A self is elsewhere. 
These kinds of ideas. 
One representation, two. 
In the bottom corner of the screen is a timer. 
A mindset colors every word and interpretation. 
Earlier we managed to push his car out. 
One fallout loves the other. 
Ideas, or pieces of pictures moving. 
Purpose occurs concurrently with language. 
Snow piled on the curb, plows moved around. 
We didnt talk much about ourselves, there wasnt any time. 
I approach the burned out automobile with caution. 
I wonder what my statue would look like? 
Pieces fit pressed against each other or magnets work hard. 
In Russia they wonder if the old guard has moved on. 
Sitting in a kitchen, a clean place to write, a television, quietly.
