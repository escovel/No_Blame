A trench leads to each house.
Some people are born with webbing between their toes.
Let this plane rise.
My “Kansas City Royals” hat is dirty as hell.
a postal distribution center
Horses and people used to be smaller.
 “A stone mason uses the stone, yet he does not use it up.”
My neck bends like a branch covered in snow.
A mindset colors every word and interpretation. 
Wind swept plaza at the corner of 34th and 7th. 
“I reckon a feller needs a change of pace.”
Like a magnet like concrete the man’s eyes were rotten two holes like a plug. 
a great catch
Summer lives alone.
Keep to one self keep your head on straight keep trying.
Like the sun on one's face the smell of grass.
