Things I will never understand.
Sucking on a dog's eyeball.
How many days have I missed?
Carry your body as you would a baby. 
Purpose occurs concurrently with language.
Isolating each thought, picking them apart from each other.
To whom is this directed?
Imagine its shape. 
Two-hundred meters of free style, circular and simple.
Wanting to impress the leather jacket.
Why are you leaving?
Count the number of ships in the harbor. 
Ideas, or pieces of pictures moving. 
Terrified of missing out, the sun rose early.
Have you seen them race each other?
Imagine the in-seam running on forever, to China.
