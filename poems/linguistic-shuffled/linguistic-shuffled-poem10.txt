I found my body pensive and motionless.
A pair of pants that fits.
At work, one is a distraction from the other.
Found object as feeling: I stare at an advertisement.
I shook my head yes, empty.
A classic is something that is always nice.
When silence becomes part of discourse, physicality shifts from an idea to an actor. 
Sub-headline: “Poll: Bush vulnerable vs. leading democrats”.
I approach the burned out automobile with caution.
A snake bashes its front tooth on a rock.
Because of a peculiarity in spirit we might think about where we are.
NO. 1 IN THE USA.
I want to be a better person
A windy day.
All the winners have medals.
I don’t remember: I don’t remember being small.
