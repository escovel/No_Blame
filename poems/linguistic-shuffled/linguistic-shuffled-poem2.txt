An old man wanders without bearing.
A wool sweater, independent.
There’s so much to say about appearance: old pink T-shirt.
One writes to understand.
A sea shell.
A dog crawls under the porch to die.
It came from the sky, mostly.
Three is a pattern, a fourth is one more. 
A lap is there and back.
a loose fitting t-shirt
Why do A’ and B’ seem to be linked? 
Sadness. 
A garden insists on itself and pushes the dirt aside.
A rut gleaming in the snow.
I’ve never seen a dinosaur though I’ve seen its skeleton.
This will not stop.
