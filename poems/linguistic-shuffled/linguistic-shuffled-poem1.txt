Alpha-Romeo.
I wake up at eight I shoot the machine gun. 
Bob.
A meteorite hits the earth: Iâ€™ll give you something to cry about.
Soap is clean by definition.
I electrocute the bumblebee. 
Walt Whitman found god in a barley corn.
A joke, a dense work of metal. 
Snow piled on the curb, plows moved around.
I love you like a pig in a barnyard.
Matt.
A self is elsewhere.
Man wearing a hat, sitting in a wheel chair, surrounded by sheep and the sun is shining.
I presume the thing before the thing, ideas of what the world is 
Tom.
A dog crawls under the porch to die.
