The Nation’s Paper.
We’re older now, more interesting.
Being happy. 
Bodies filled with cream and butter.
Silence.
They’re racing across the pool, racing each other.
Dipping a hand into water. 
Grass grows where other grass grows.
the odds
We find what we are looking for by isolating what we are looking for from the things around it.
Towards an immense capital, a caustic depth.
Geese fly south in the winter.
F.B.I.
We find the relationships we are looking for. 
Whistling for the winner, women, commercial.
Cities know what they want.
