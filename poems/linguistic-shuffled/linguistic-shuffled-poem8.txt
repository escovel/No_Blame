A: (no reply)
If I disappeared today tomorrow would you carry a picture of someone not here anymore?
Judge motioning with his left hand, arm extended forward as if preparing to hand shake.
A pact was made between the settlers and the natives.
“I can think of nothing less likely to fly.” 
And then I draped my arm around her.
Legs propped on a table, sits in an orange chair.
A man drinks his Coke.
“My dear quiet love,” she wrote.
without consultation. 
Passengers don’t ask.
A man with blood on his head stumbles into the street.
“I can’t find the enemy,” he said.
Like the meticulous design of a park a trash can.
Watercress.
A poem comes into focus.
