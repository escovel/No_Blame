A man with blood on his head stumbles into the street. 
Wind swept plaza at the corner of 34th and 7th. 
Sadness. 
I think Im beginning to know what this is. 
The corner of 42nd and 6th. 
Its not hard to leave you just do it. 
Unless you miss the bus, I thought to myself. 
A windy day. 
It doesnt matter how you do it. 
I thought I. 
A man drinks his Coke. 
The shadow of One Penn Plaza. 
Between us, a young couple escapes into each other. 
An old man wanders without bearing. 
The pull of the moon. 
The pull of the tides on the shore.
