The frog made a squishing sound in my hand the sky opened up like a head of lettuce. 
Like Stephen Hawking sorrow expanding like a rowers meticulous form. 
The machine in a trance its metal arm swings. 
The sounds of a shovel and now the work man and now the work man. 
I wake up at eight I shoot the machine gun. 
I electrocute the bumblebee. 
Like a magnet like concrete the mans eyes were rotten two holes like a plug. 
Like the meticulous design of a park a trash can. 
Because of a peculiarity in spirit we might think about where we are. 
I flick an insect off the bed. 
Not like a bonnet pushed back a horde of neck and hands. 
Like a true story a cows eye. 
I found my body pensive and motionless. 
I found a hole in my sock I found a foot stool. 
If I disappeared today tomorrow would you carry a picture of someone not here anymore? 
Would you carry a Styrofoam cup to a trash can?
