A self is made of words. Every moment seen is elsewhere, 
The best I can do is describe it. 
A self is elsewhere. 
Count the number of ships coming into this harbor. 
A mindset colors every word and interpretation. 
I presume the thing before the thing, ideas of what the world is 
without consultation. 
A stone mason uses the stone, yet he does not use it up. 
A poem comes into focus. 
Purpose occurs concurrently with language. 
I want to be a better person 
for you. 
I wonder what my statue would look like? 
said the little girl to her father. 
She held her hem at arms length and admired her shadow. 
He did the same.
