It came from the sky, mostly. 
To see what life was like I asked the man pushing his car. 
Pieces fit pressed against each other or magnets work hard. 
A joke, a dense work of metal. 
Bodies filled with cream and butter. 
Snow piled on the curb, plows moved around. 
Making sure they were safe I said goodbye, cotton. 
A wool sweater, independent. 
Carry your body as you would a baby. 
Possession. I never knew how exciting addiction could be. 
Walking over a sheet of ice, I take small steps. 
A trench leads to each house. 
Our rent was due: the streets were full of snow. 
These kinds of ideas. 
Earlier we managed to push his car out. 
A rut gleaming in the snow.
