In the bottom corner of the screen is a timer. 
Have you seen them race each other? 
Two-hundred meters of free style, circular and simple. 
Whistling for the winner, women, commercial. 
Sitting in a kitchen, a clean place to write, a television, quietly. 
Isolating each thought, picking them apart from each other. 
All the winners have medals. 
What is this thing hanging from my neck? 
At work, one is a distraction from the other. 
Ideas, or pieces of pictures moving. 
An ornate bridge leads to an empty parking lot. 
How many days have I missed? 
Theyre racing across the pool, racing each other. 
Instincts or repeated thoughts, swimmers appear on the television. 
A lap is there and back. 
I approach the burned out automobile with caution.
