Sucking on a dog's eyeball.
Keep at it. 
Silence.
The shape of gravity.
Wanting to impress the leather jacket.
Keep to one self keep your head on straight keep trying.
This will not stop.
The shape of a life too huge to imagine.
Dipping a hand into water. 
What is it about no-eye? 
Poles between us. 
The seat of grass distributed evenly.
Being happy.
Like the sun on one's face the smell of grass.
No-eye 
The curve rolls silently down the hill.
