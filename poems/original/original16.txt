Was talking to nobody (wide eyes). 
The bottom of the lake: tongue. 
To whom is this directed? 
Bodies filled with cream and butter. 
And then I draped my arm around her. 
The city extended: tongue. 
Let this plane rise. 
Wings tear off: stratosphere. 
I can think of nothing less likely to fly. 
The body aches and fills. 
Is nothing fuel? 
Passengers dont ask. 
We cant keep doing this. 
Weather: should we be worried? 
Exit and note loss clearly. 
Without permission we taxi.
