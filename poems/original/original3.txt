A classic is something that is always nice. 
I dont remember: I dont remember being small. 
If there is no theory it was nice to see you. 
City: those who may have developed. 
A snake bashes its front tooth on a rock. 
I shook my head yes, empty. 
Terrified on missing out, the sun rose early. 
One writes to understand. 
A garden insists on itself and pushes the dirt aside. 
My dear quiet love, she wrote. 
It was a small moon but managed to guide us. 
Summer lives alone. 
We write poems like zippers. 
I love you like a pig in a barnyard. 
Towards an immense capital, a caustic depth. 
Soap is clean by definition.
