and Tyler.
and Andy.
And then I draped my arm around her.
Like the sun on one's face the smell of grass.
Like Stephen Hawking sorrow expanding like a rower’s meticulous form. 
Like a magnet like concrete the man’s eyes were rotten two holes like a plug. 
Like the meticulous design of a park a trash can.
Like a true story a cow’s eye.
Not like a bonnet pushed back a horde of neck and hands.
If I disappeared today tomorrow would you carry a picture of someone not here anymore?
If there is no theory it was “nice to see you.”
without consultation. 
for you.
Unless you miss the bus, I thought to myself.
My neck bends like a branch covered in snow.
My “Kansas City Royals” hat is dirty as hell.
