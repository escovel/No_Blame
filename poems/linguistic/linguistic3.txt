A dog crawls under the porch to die.
A dog crawls under the porch to die.
A dog crawls under the porch to die.
A meteorite hits the earth: Iâ€™ll give you something to cry about.
A self is made of words. Every moment seen is elsewhere, 
A self is elsewhere.
A mindset colors every word and interpretation. 
a great catch
an orange cone, an orange jumpsuit
a loose fitting t-shirt
a postal distribution center
A joke, a dense work of metal. 
A wool sweater, independent.
A trench leads to each house.
A rut gleaming in the snow.
An ornate bridge.
