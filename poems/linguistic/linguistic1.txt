I wake up at eight I shoot the machine gun. 
I electrocute the bumblebee. 
I flick an insect off the bed.
I found my body pensive and motionless.
I found a hole in my sock I found a foot stool.
I think I’m beginning to know what this is. 
I think I’m beginning to know what this is. 
I thought I.
I shook my head yes, empty.
I love you like a pig in a barnyard.
I can only imagine with the help of a toy.
I presume the thing before the thing, ideas of what the world is 
I want to be a better person
I approach the burned out automobile with caution.
Was talking to nobody.
Things I will never understand.
