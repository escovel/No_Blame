Summer lives alone.
Cities know what they want.
Soap is clean by definition.
Grass grows where other grass grows.
Geese fly south in the winter.
Horses and people used to be smaller.
Bodies filled with cream and butter.
Snow piled on the curb, plows moved around.
Wind swept plaza at the corner of 34th and 7th. 
Passengers donâ€™t ask.
Man wearing a hat, sitting in a wheel chair, surrounded by sheep and the sun is shining.
Legs propped on a table, sits in an orange chair.
Judge motioning with his left hand, arm extended forward as if preparing to hand shake.
Alpha-Romeo.
Watercress.
Some people are born with webbing between their toes.
