A lap is there and back.
A classic is something that is always nice.
A windy day.
A garden insists on itself and pushes the dirt aside.
A man drinks his Coke.
A man with blood on his head stumbles into the street.
An old man wanders without bearing.
A snake bashes its front tooth on a rock.
A caricature of yourself, a copy or faking imitation.
A pair of pants that fits.
A sea shell.
A dog crawls under the porch to die.
A poem comes into focus.
A slow and clumsy ape falls from a tree.
A bird calls from the back of a rhinoceros.
A pact was made between the settlers and the natives.
