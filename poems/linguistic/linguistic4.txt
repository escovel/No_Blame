The Pistons have lost their identity.
The interviewer laughed and asked him to talk some more.
The shape of a life too huge to imagine.
The shape of gravity.
The seat of grass distributed evenly.
The curve rolls silently down the hill.
The body aches and fills.
The thinning neck eventually pinches and the drop drips.
The shadow of One Penn Plaza.
The corner of 42nd and 6th. 
The pull of the moon. 
The pull of the tides on the shore. 
The machine in a trance its metal arm swings.
The sounds of a shovel and now the work man and now the work man.
The frog made a squishing sound in my hand the sky opened up like a head of lettuce. 
The best I can do is describe it.
