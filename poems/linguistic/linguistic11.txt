Sucking on a dog's eyeball.
Dipping a hand into water. 
Wanting to impress the leather jacket.
Being happy. 
Whistling for the winner, women, commercial.
Making sure they were safe I said goodbye, cotton.
Walking over a sheet of ice, I mince my steps.
Sitting in a kitchen, a clean place to write, a television, quietly.
Isolating each thought, picking them apart from each other.
Notices the small cut healing over thumb of the right hand.
Looks off, away from the newspaper, painting above the couch.
Shifts legs and runs fingers across lips, rubs nose.
Towards an immense capital, a caustic depth.
Terrified of missing out, the sun rose early.
said the little girl to her father. 
Going through one of those cycles.
